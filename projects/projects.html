                  LiveRail is a simple, straightforward, vite-powered React
                  application that utilizes the Tfl's (Transport for London) API
                  to provide real-time data on London's underground trains.

                  Over the past year, I have taught myself how to code. I have
                  learned and continue to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                  React. To further hone my skills, I've worked on numerous
                  mini-projects. However, this is my first fully-fledged React
                  project, and I'm excited to share it with the Creative
                  Computing Institute at UAL. While I'm aware there is still
                  much room for improvement within this project, I wanted to
                  showcase my coding capabilities thus far to the Admissions
                  team at CCI while acknowledging that my technical capabilities
                  in this new industry have much room for improvement. I believe
                  CCI can significantly help me enhance my technical skills in
                  this industry, which I have found myself so deeply interested
                  in. I hope you enjoy the project.

                    Once a line is selected, a pop-up menu appears displaying

                  This project challenged my knowledge in various areas.
                  LiveRail is the first React project I have made without the
                  support and assistance of Codecademy - a learning platform
                  I've utilised to gain technical knowledge. I often reviewed
                  MDN pages and reviewed my course material to grasp the
                  concepts necessary to put this together. I found fetching the
                  API relatively simple; however, displaying the data, dealing
                  with state management, and ensuring all my components
                  communicated effectively took a few tries. Additionally, there
                  is room for improvement within this project concerning the
                  organisation of my code and features to improve user
                  experience, notably making sure my applications align with
                  ARIA standards and bettering the implementation of responsive
                  design. Nevertheless, I hope this small application is
                  enjoyable, and it was important to me to showcase what
                  demonstrates the culmination of the skills I've been building
                  over the past year.
